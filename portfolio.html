	<h2> Project 1.1.9: Donut Shop</h2>
	    <img src = "pictures/project119result.jpg" alt = "Picture of the final result of the donut shop project." width = 600 height = 400>
	    <p>For this project the user chooses how many donuts they want, the type of frosting they want, if they want sprinkles, and then if they want a box to go with it. During the process it makes the donuts in front of the user. <br>
		    We use different sizes for the donut, hole, and sprinkles along with loops to make all donuts and sprinkles.</p>

	<h2> Project 1.2.5: Feed The Minions</h2>
	    <img src = "pictures/project125result.PNG" alt = "Picture of the final result of the Feed the Minions project." width = 600 height = 500>
	    <p>The user plays as Gru and goes around throwing bananas at the angry minions. Each minion fed adds to their score, and when time is up it shows the top 5 scores.
	    Used lists to store all the minions, user input gained from writing name, moving Gru, and throwing bananas. We also used functions for moving around, spawning minions, and feeding minions.</p>

	<h2> Scratch Project: Geometry Dash Remixed</h2>
	    <img src = "pictures/scratchProject.PNG" alt = "Picture of the final result of Geometry Dash Remixed.">
	    <p>The user controls the box, and the goal is to jump over spikes and not run in to walls. When you click, press "w", or the up arrow key, the box will jump up. Achieved animations with spinning, counters with keeping track of player sprites, 
		    procedures by calling a jumpMovement method, costumes by changing the character sprite every 100 score, sounds by having background music and death noise, events by making player die when hitting wall or spike, 
		    and scores by increasing the score as player styas alive.</p>
