	<h3> Project 1.1.9 Donut Shop</h3>
	    <img src = "pictures/project119result.png" alt = "Picture of the final result of the donut shop project." >
	    <p>For this project the user chooses how many donuts they want, the type of frosting they want, if they want sprinkles, and then if they want a box to go with it. During the process it makes the donuts in front of the user. <br>
		    We use different sizes for the donut, hole, and sprinkles along with loops to make all donuts and sprinkles.</p>
