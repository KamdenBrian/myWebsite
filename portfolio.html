	<h2> Project 1.1.9 Donut Shop</h2>
	    <img src = "pictures/project119result.jpg" alt = "Picture of the final result of the donut shop project." width = 600 height = 400>
	    <p>For this project the user chooses how many donuts they want, the type of frosting they want, if they want sprinkles, and then if they want a box to go with it. During the process it makes the donuts in front of the user. <br>
		    We use different sizes for the donut, hole, and sprinkles along with loops to make all donuts and sprinkles.</p>

	<h2> Project 1.2.5 Feed The Minions</h2>
	    <img src = "pictures/project125result.PNG" alt = "Picture of the final result of the Feed the Minions project." width = 600 height = 400>
	    <p>The user plays as Gru and goes around throwing bananas at the angry minions. Each minion fed adds to their score, and when time is up it shows the top 5 scores.
	    Used lists to store all the minions, user input gained from writing name, moving Gru, and throwing bananas. </p>
